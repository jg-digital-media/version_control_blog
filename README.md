# version_control_blog - 28-02-2024 - 16:38
Final repository linked to my blog on using version control e.g. Git in your projects


## Latest Blog Edits

```
The purpose of this blog is to simulate the process of website/software development using version control. Part of the reason for this is because I so often work on my own and I'm not experienced in using Git to work in collaboration with others. I work with branches of course and try to introduce changes to code safely and iteratively but that's really it.  

I love working with Git to manage my work and as a backup source.  So on the 28th February I created a simple page that acts as a "development log" which represent stages of development of a project.  The "project" can be anything you like but in reality the repository  [LINK]is just this page.

Let's get started.  (I'll show all my working out on the way)
